## A Little About Me

Flunked out of Electrical Engineering 🤭, fell in love with majoring in Asian American Studies 💜, and somehow am back in Engineering ✊🏽. I spend most of my time thinking about how to save developer hours 💰. Proud to say that automated deployments, scratch org creation, and similar tasks I've built have saved my last company $524,312 annually. As a Salesforce DevOps Engineer ☁️, I have experience releasing managed packages 📦 at ISVs and building automated Robot Framework tests on CI/CD tools likes Salesforce DX and CumulusCI 🌧💰. Most importantly, I'm passionate about working on products that create social good 🌈.
