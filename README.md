# Julian Joseph ☁️

I'm a Quality Engineer @ [Salesforce.com](Salesforce.com).

I enjoy [Automating Salesforce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B03PY9RUUqw).


## A Little About Me

Flunked out of Electrical Engineering 🤭, fell in love with majoring in Asian American Studies 💜, and somehow am back in Engineering ✊🏽. I spend most of my time worrying 😱 about potential bugs 🐛 or confusing UIs 🤦🏾‍♂️ so users don't have to. Specifically, I'm a Quality Engineer at Salesforce ☁️ with experience releasing managed packages 📦 and building automated robot framework tests 🤖on CI/CD tools likes Salesforce DX and CumulusCI 🌧💰. But most importantly, I'm passionate about working on products that create social good 🌈.
